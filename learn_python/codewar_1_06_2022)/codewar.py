Bit Counting.
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

Split Strings.

Binary Addition
Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....Â¡Eureka!!
The number 89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? Because this sum gives the same number.

In effect: 89 = 8^1 + 9^2
The next number in having this property is 135.
See this property again: 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3

sum_dig_pow(1, 100) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
